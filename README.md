# Ideal-Gas-and-Pipe-Flow-Calculator
Engineers often need quick calculations for state properties (like pressure and temperature changes in a closed system) or flow characteristics (like Reynolds number to determine if flow is laminar or turbulent). Manually solving these repetitive equations is time-consuming and error-prone. A specialized calculator speeds up this process.
